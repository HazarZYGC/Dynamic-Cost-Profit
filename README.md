# Dynamic-Cost-Profit

## Scenario of the Code:

### Part-1:

Assume that you are the owner of a car company. Your company has enough employees to
produce `p` cars for each month. However, the number of the demand for the cars differs from
month to month. You should design a sales plan for the next `x` months. Consider `i` is the index
of each month (i=1,…,x) and m i is the demand for i th month. If your company needs to produce
more than ‘p’ cars for a month, you can hire some interns, paying `d` TL per car for that month.
Moreover, if your company keeps any unsold car at the end the month, you should pay a
`garage cost`. The garage cost will be calculated by the function `G(j)`.

### Part-2:

Besides, you must invest the payment that earned from your sales. Cost of each car is `B` TL and
you get half of the price at the beginning of the month and the rest will be taken at the end of
the month. You have offers from `c` different investment companies. Each investment company
offers different rate for each month. At the end of each month, you can change your 
investment company by paying a taxes at a rate `t` of your invested money or continue with the
same investment company without paying any taxes.
