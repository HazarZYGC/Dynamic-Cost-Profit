# Dynamic-Cost-Profit

##Scenario of the Code:##

###Part-1###

Assume that you are the owner of a car company. Your company has enough employees to
produce `p` cars for each month. However, the number of the demand for the cars differs from
month to month. You should design a sales plan for the next `x` months. Consider `i` is the index
of each month (i=1,…,x) and m i is the demand for i th month. If your company needs to produce
more than ‘p’ cars for a month, you can hire some interns, paying `d` TL per car for that month.
Moreover, if your company keeps any unsold car at the end the month, you should pay a
`garage cost`. The garage cost will be calculated by the function `G(j)`.
